                    <h4>Patience</h4>
                    <p>Be kind to yourself. When things become challenging, and they will, take a deep breath, stay calm, take a break and know things will all workout in the end. </p>

                    <h4>Planning</h4>
                    <p>One of the best things you can do to reduce frustration is to plan. Plan out your projects, your next step and your ideas. Coding without a plan is like trying to write with blinders on. You'll soon find you're all over the place. </p>

                    <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
                    <p>Having good problem solving skills is a great asset. Here are the steps I use: Identif the problem. Gather information about the root cause of the problem. Generate possible solutions. Evaluate ideas and then try them out until you find one that works.
                        Evaluate. </p>

                    <h4>Practice</h4>
                    <p><span>Practice! Practice! Practice!</span> The old saying "Practice makes perfect!" is true. Daily practice truly is the key to reinforce what you are learning.</p>

                    <h4>Perserverance</h4>
                    <p>Whatever you do, don't give up. Every step you take is a step closer to your goal. And if you follow the second P, Planning, you will find that you'll complete your steps in record time.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>You're closer to your goal than you think. Good luck!</strong></p>
